## 🌸 AURA 🌸

AURA (Assisted User Reactive AI) is my personal project – a small wearable AI companion.
It’s meant to feel less like a gadget and more like a gentle friend by your side ☁️✨.

At the heart of AURA is Asuna 🌙, a custom-built AI that makes everything feel alive.
Together, they’re meant to interact naturally through voice 🎐 and gestures 🍃, helping with little everyday moments in a calm and simple way 🌸.

This repo is just a quiet place where I’ll share their story as AURA and Asuna slowly bloom 🌱🌷.
