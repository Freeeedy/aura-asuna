## 🌸 AURA 🌸

AURA (Assisted User Reactive AI) is my personal project – a small wearable AI companion.

At the heart of AURA is Asuna, a custom-built AI that makes everything feel alive.
Together, they’re meant to interact naturally through voice and gestures, helping with little everyday moments in a calm and simple way.
